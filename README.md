# DATA-ANALYSIS
1. Abstract -
This project does Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a dataset for movie data like gross revenue, runtime, meta scores, IMDb ratings, genres, and certificates. The principal goals are cleaning the dataset, revenue trend analysis, visualization of genre distribution, and identifying revenue outliers with the help of Python tools data science methodologies.

2. Introduction -
Box office performance data, runtime, and genre trends in the movie industry are what movie industry statistics mirror. Based on a real movie dataset, the purpose of this project is to extract insightful information with Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

3. Methodology -
•  Load dataset using Pandas
•  Clean the data (remove missing values)
•  Use summary statistics to understand the revenue and rating distribution
•  Create visualizations to explore genres and gross revenue
•  Detect outliers using the IQR method


4. Objectives - 
Understand and load the dataset: Familiarize yourself with the organization and composition of the movie dataset with Pandas and preview initial records.

Clean and prepare the data: Detect missing or invalid values and get the dataset ready for analysis through simple data wrangling procedures.

Analyze revenue distribution: Utilize descriptive statistics and graphical tools such as histograms and boxplots to discover how gross revenue is distributed within the dataset.

Investigate genres and their trends in revenue: Determine the most frequent genres and contrast how gross revenue differs across them through visualization such as bar charts and pie charts.

Find outliers and make conclusions: Use IQR-based outlier detection to find atypical revenue values that could influence general analysis, and provide key patterns and findings of the EDA.

5. Results and Analysis - 
The dataset was free of any missing values post-cleaning.

Summary statistics reported a broad array of gross revenue values.

A few genres occur more than others.

Outliers existed in gross revenue data that affect average-based inferences.
