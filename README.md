This project does Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a dataset for movie data like gross revenue, runtime, meta scores, IMDb ratings, genres, and certificates. The principal goals are cleaning the dataset, revenue trend analysis, visualization of genre distribution, and identifying revenue outliers with the help of Python tools data science methodologies.

2. Introduction -
Box office performance data, runtime, and genre trends in the movie industry are what movie industry statistics mirror. Based on a real movie dataset, the purpose of this project is to extract insightful information with Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

•  Load dataset using Pandas
•  Clean the data (remove missing values)
•  Use summary statistics to understand the revenue and rating distribution
•  Create visualizations to explore genres and gross revenue
•  Detect outliers using the IQR method
